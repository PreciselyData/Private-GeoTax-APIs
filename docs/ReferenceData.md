The GeoTax solution relies on reference data stored on mounted file storage for
geotax operations. It's crucial to ensure that this reference data is available in the cluster's mounted
storage before initiating the deployment of the GeoTax Helm Chart.

To accommodate reference data and software upgrades, you should upload newer data to the recommended location or folder
on the mounted storage. The GeoTax Helm Chart can then be rolled out with the new reference data location
seamlessly and with zero downtime.


# Reference Data Structure

As a generalized step, the reference data should exist in the following format only:
<br>`[basePath]/[geotax]/[current-timestamp]/[vintage]/[data]`

NOTE: The current-time folder name should always be in the format: `YYMMDDhhmm` e.g. 202311081159
```
basePath/
â”œâ”€â”€ geotax/
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 202311081159/
